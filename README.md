Purpose of the page:

* Summary of machine learning models commonly used for regression / classification (from scikit-learn)
* Focuses on the applications of the models
* Reading through documentation about these models can often be very intimidating for beginners, especially when you do not have a strong math background. This is meant to be written for more people to understand the difference between models.
* I am not an expert by any means, some say one of the best ways to learn is by teaching. Every header is a link to offical websites with more in depth information.
